## Nim Game – Player vs AI(Minimax)
# Description

This is a simple Nim Game built using Python Tkinter where a human player competes against an AI opponent.
Both players take turns removing 1, 2, or 3 coins from a pile. The player who takes the last coin wins.

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to play optimally — making it challenging for the player to win!

# Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system.

You can check by running:

python --version
# Step 2: Run the File

- Save the game as Nim.py
- Open a terminal or command prompt in the file location

Run:
