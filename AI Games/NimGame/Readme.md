## Nim Game – Player vs AI(Minimax)
# Description

This is a simple Nim Game built using Python Tkinter where a human player competes against an AI opponent.
Both players take turns removing 1, 2, or 3 coins from a pile. The player who takes the last coin wins.

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to play optimally — making it challenging for the player to win!
