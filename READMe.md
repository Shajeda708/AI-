#  Artificial Intelligence (AI) Course

## Purpose of this Course:

The main purpose of this course is to understand the fundamental and advanced concepts of **Artificial Intelligence**, learn how intelligent systems work, and implement core AI algorithms and games to develop problem-solving skills and real-world application.

Through both theory and practical lab tasks, this course provides a strong foundation for designing AI-driven applications.

## What I Learned from this Course
During this course, I learned to:
- Learn what is AI, Approaches to AI(Turing Test),Agents(structure of agent,problem solving agent),Environment
- Understand basic AI concepts such as search strategies, heuristics, and optimization.
- Implement AI search algorithms like:
  - BFS,DFS,Bidirectional,DLS,IDS ;these are uninformed search algorithm.
  - A*,Best first search,Beam search;these are informed(Heuristic) search algorithm.
- Optimization Algorithms (Hill Climbing)
- Gaming Algorithm (Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning)
- Constrain satisfaction problem 
- Develop AI-based games (like Tic-Tac-Toe,Chess using gaming algorithm).
- Use AI tools for video and presentation creation.
- Applications of AI in real-world systems.
